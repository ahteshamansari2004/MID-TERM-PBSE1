Area,Feature / Improvement,Justification
Data Migration, Cloud Persistence: Implement a simple backend (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, or a custom Node.js API with MongoDB/PostgreSQL) to store the sessions array and user profiles.",Enables multi-device access and lays the foundation for all future features and integrations.
UX/UI, Calendar View: Introduce a visual Month View and Week View in addition to the current day view. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering/rescheduling sessions.,"Enhances user control, making the schedule easily editable and scannable."
Core Logic," Workload Calibration: Add a user feedback mechanism to the stats page (""Did this task take the estimated time?""). Use this data to automatically refine difficulty weights for the scheduling algorithm over time.",Improves the core intelligence of the product.
Technology," Framework Adoption: Transition the Vanilla JS application to a modern framework (e.g., Vue.js or React) for better state management, maintainability, and scalability.",Prepares the codebase for rapid feature development in the subsequent phases.

                                             PHASE 2: 1 YEAR

Area,Feature / Improvement,Justification
Accessibility," Mobile App: Develop native or cross-platform (React Native/Flutter) mobile apps for iOS and Android, leveraging the new cloud backend.","Crucial for student use, allowing on-the-go viewing, checking off tasks, and receiving reminders."
Integration, Calendar Sync (2-Way): Implement integrations with Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar via their APIs. Planned sessions sync out; existing classes sync in.,Eliminates double-entry and seamlessly incorporates the user's fixed class schedule into the planner.
AI/Logic,"Grade Tracking: Add a module to track grades, subject weight, and course requirements. The algorithm should prioritize scheduling tasks for subjects where the user's current grade is lowest or deadlines are most critical.","Adds a strategic layer to planning, directly tying study time to academic results."
Productivity,🎧 Focus Mode Enhancements: Integrate with ambient sound libraries or focus music services (similar to Spotify or YouTube Music integration) directly within the Pomodoro module.,Improves the user's ability to maintain focus and reduces the need to switch apps.


                                         PHASE 3: 2 YEARS
Area,Feature / Improvement,Justification
Advanced AI," Adaptive Planning: The scheduling algorithm evolves to use historical user data (completion times, streaks, and grades) to predict the optimal study environment (time of day, length of session) for different subjects and adjust future plans automatically.","Provides a genuinely personalized experience, differentiating the product from basic planner apps."
Ecosystem, LMS Integration: Integrate with major Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Canvas and Moodle.,"Allows automatic import of assignments, due dates, and lecture schedules directly into the planner, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry."
Collaboration,👥 Group Study Planning: Enable sharing of study sessions or projects with a small group of users. Allows group members to see when others are scheduling group work or when a project component is due.,"Caters to the collaborative nature of university life (group projects, study partners)."
Monetization," Premium Features: Introduce premium tiers for features like Unlimited Cloud Storage, Advanced Analytics (e.g., burnout prediction, personalized performance reports), and Priority Support.",Establishes a sustainable business model for continued development.
