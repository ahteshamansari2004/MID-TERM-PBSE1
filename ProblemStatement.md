To see the Preview of the website that i will be making i used lovable ( website maker) just for an idea how my website would look like and how much perfection and features it needs during that use when i prompted and got the websute editing or adding any features I WAS OUT OF CREDITS in order to do any changing I had to buy the premium therefore i couldnt continue withit or wait couple of hours that would waste my time.
then i went to claud ai best known for its coding capabilities i prompted but how i needed the websute it wasnt it i needed more and more things but it eneded up going worse which ended up making me frustrated and issues withn backend not running or buttons with no functions so Claude Ai was also not a good option and after several attempts i have to wait for 12 hours so no chance of making the project by it 
then used  an ai deepsite new to me as i searched it from the google used it but it wasnt providing the proper files required for my vs code it added all files made a project so advance that it wasnt easy to understand and the changnibgs were not easy to implement, I needed the project which I can fukky understdn the code its working how it works and how helpful it os therefore it wasnt  away to go and needed an amount for it to me presentable
Then I thought of using the Gemini pro but i have to verify myself as a student for it which would take much time therefore i started with basic i prompted it it made a website but it has several ui problems and buttons features wasnt working properly but after my prompting skills and making it work editing code by adding it by snippets made it work.

The main problems I faced using the Ai was that there are several requirements for any websute or app wether making it from the ai or a human so needs are changing according to the needs AI is not effiecent maked problems previous working things dont work in the next generated code thios can be an issue very difficult to make a website according to the desired needs and features working stably.
